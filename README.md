# Premier League Final Standings Prediction (2020-2025)

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the final standings of Premier League teams using team performance statistics.

The model is trained using data from the past four seasons (2020–2024), and applied to the ongoing 2024–2025 season.  
All data used for the 2024–2025 season was collected **up to 26 April 2025**, before the final results were known.

## Project Structure

## Project Data Snapshot
- The Premier League match statistics were collected on **26 April 2025**.
- All predictions are made based on team performances up to this date.
- Final results were not known at the time of modeling.

## Workflow
- Data Collection (past 4 seasons + current partial season)
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering (e.g., combining home and away stats)
- Model Training (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- Predicting Final Standings for 2024–2025 Season

## Data Snapshot Timing
- **Past Seasons (2020–2024):** Full season statistics were used.
- **Current Season (2024–2025):** Data up to **26 April 2025** only.

## Future Improvements
- Update predictions as new match data comes in.
- Add player-level data (e.g., goalscorers, assists).
- Experiment with XGBoost or other advanced models.
